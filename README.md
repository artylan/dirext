# DirExtQt
This small app displays an overview of file extension of all files in a chosen directory. It can be run from the commandline and from GUI. It is tested with the current Qt-Creator 4.13.2 and Visual Studio Community 2019 on Windows 10 and with Qt-Creator 4.13.2 on Ubuntu 20.10.
It uses only Qt data types, so it should run on Mac also.
If you call it from command line, you can pass a directory as first (and only) parameter. If you call it without parameters, a file dialog appears, where you can specify the directory.
Have fun.
