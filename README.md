# DirExtQt
This small app displays an overview of file extensions of all files in a selected directory and all of its subdirectories. It can be run from the commandline and from GUI. It is tested with the Qt-Creator 4.13.2 and Visual Studio Community 2019 on Windows 10 and with Qt-Creator 4.13.2 on Ubuntu 20.10.

It uses only Qt data types, so it should run on Mac also.

If you call it from command line, you can pass a directory as first (and only) parameter. If you call it without parameters, a file dialog appears, where you can specify the directory.

You can download an Windows 10 installer at https://artur-wystub.de/blog/dirextqt/. Have fun.
